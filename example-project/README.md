Fair-Score (aka Objectball’s Revenge) will be a basic, user-friendly scorekeeping application for recreational sports. A lot of rec sports scoring software is outdated or glitchy, this application will allow for keeping as many or as few stats as a scorekeeper wants, easily and consistently.

A user will be able to log in as a commissioner, captain, or player. Commissioners will have access to every player’s stats. Captains will have access to their team’s players’ stats. Players will have access to their own stats.

Users will be able to update statistics live during games. The first sport will be basketball, and points will be taken from each individual player’s stats to create the score of a game. Live scores, as well as schedules will be available. Users will be able to create teams and set schedules and create their own profiles as players.
